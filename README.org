*** Debian / Ubuntu
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
apt install postgresql postgis postgresql-10-pgrouting osmosis
#+END_SRC

** PostGIS
PostGIS is built on top of PostgreSQL, which is considered to be the most versatile open source database available. For clarity, all example SQL statements in this document will have /delimited identifiers/. This makes it immediately clear what is SQL syntax and what is an identifier.
*** PostgreSQL

*** PostGIS
**** Creating a PostGIS/pgRouting database
First we have to create the database.
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
create database "autograph";
#+END_SRC

Then connect to the new database, either by typing "=\c autograph=" in the =psql= prompt, or from the shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
psql -d autograph
#+END_SRC

Now, from the =psql= prompt we can install the necessary extensions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
create extension postgis;
create extension pgrouting;
#+END_SRC

**** Loading OSM data into PostGIS
Prepare the PostGIS database to accept OSM data. The schema is shipped with the Osmosis installation:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
psql -d autograph -f /usr/share/doc/osmosis/examples/pgsimple_schema_0.6.sql
#+END_SRC

More on PostGIS schemas can be found at the OSM Wiki: [[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql/schema]]

Use Osmosis to load OSM data into the database
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
osmosis --rb file=netherlands-latest.osm.pbf --ws host="localhost" database="autograph"
#+END_SRC
Take a cup of coffee. In fact, go on a hiking trip through the Alps to arrive in northern Italy, find a nice espresso bar, have some good coffee. Doing this with the Luxembourg dataset takes about one minute on a laptop, all of the Netherlands may take more than two hours.

**** Second way of loading OSM data into PostGIS
Download a =osm.bz2= file. Run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
osm2pgsql -d luxembourg -U postgres -P 5432 luxembourg-latest.osm.bz2
#+END_SRC

This loads the data in a schema that QGis also understands, and is faster than using =osmosis=.

**** Keeping PostGIS up-to-date

*** Performance
Here are some tips on setting cache sizes: [[https://postgis.net/docs/performance_tips.html#database_tuning_configuration]]

** PGRouting
PGRouting is a routing framework on top of PostGIS. For PGRouting to work, the road network needs to have a suitable network topology defined. One way to achieve this, is to import the OSM data using the =osm2pgrouting= command. This command is not as flexible with data formats as =osm2pgsql= or =osmosis=, and reads the data as unpacked XML =osm= file. This means the size of the data that can be imported in one go is limited.

For any real use, it is probably more practical to define the routing topology on top of an OSM map imported with =osm2pgsql=.

*** Create a network topology
Suppose we have created a database before, then we can add the topology as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
-- Add "source" and "target" column
ALTER TABLE planet_osm_roads ADD COLUMN "source" integer;
ALTER TABLE planet_osm_roads ADD COLUMN "target" integer;

-- Run topology function
SELECT pgr_createTopology('planet_osm_roads', 0.00001, 'way', 'osm_id');
#+END_SRC

Take a cup of coffee, doctor's orders. This operation takes a lot of memory too. Using the OSM data for the Netherlands, this took everything out of my laptop with 16GB memory and 32GB swap, but it made it!

#+BEGIN_SRC
NOTICE:  -------------> TOPOLOGY CREATED FOR  163889 edges
#+END_SRC

Unfortunately, these are the wrong 'roads'. We need to work with =planet_osm_lines=, which is a much bigger dataset. First create a table that contains only the roads.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
create table "ways_topology" as
select "osm_id" from "planet_osm_line"
where "highway" is not null;
#+END_SRC

From this we can create a view containing only the necessary information for displaying the new table.


** QGIS
*** Getting a pre-rendered OSM into QGIS
Add a new layer. Set layer source to:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
crs=EPSG:3857&format=&type=xyz&url=http://tile.openstreetmap.org/%7Bz%7D/%7Bx%7D/%7By%7D.png
#+END_EXAMPLE
The CRS will be EPSG:3857, WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator.
*** Connecting QGIS to PostGIS
Connecting to PostGIS is one of the better ways to provide QGIS with large amounts of data. The elephant logo button hides the action of adding a new source from PostGIS to the current rendering.

** Open Street Maps
*** Data description
OSM Data consists of points, lines and polygons. There is a fourth class of objects called /roads/. These are not roads. They are the major set of lines needed to depict an overview map, containing rivers, administrative boundaries and, yes, also some major roads.


To get to the road network we need to filter the /lines/ for a valid /highway/ entry. The list of values for the /highway/ column is given on the [[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway][OSM Wiki]].

Not all OSM editors adhere to these standards. If we query for all unique values in the Netherlands,

#+BEGIN_SOURCE: sql
select distinct "highway" from "planet_osm_line";
#+END_SOURCE

one entry in the Netherlands says "Luchtfoto suggereert hier een pad" (Dutch for: "Areal photo suggests a trail here").

*** Highways
| key     | value          | description                           0 |
|         |                | <25>                      |
|---------+----------------+---------------------------|
| highway | motorway       | A restricted access major divided highway, normally with 2 or more running lanes plus emergency hard shoulder. Equivalent to the Freeway, Autobahn, etc.. |
| highway | trunk          | The most important roads in a country's system that aren't motorways. (Need not necessarily be a divided highway.) |
| highway | primary        | The next most important roads in a country's system. (Often link larger towns.) |
| highway | secondary      | The next most important roads in a country's system. (Often link towns.) |
| highway | tertiary       | The next most important roads in a country's system. (Often link smaller towns and villages) |
| highway | unclassified   | The least most important through roads in a country's system â€“ i.e. minor roads of a lower classification than tertiary, but which serve a purpose other than access to properties. Often link villages and hamlets. (The word 'unclassified' is a historical artefact of the UK road system and does not mean that the classification is unknown; you can use highway=road for that.) |
| highway | residential    | Roads which serve as an access to housing, without function of connecting settlements. Often lined with housing. |
| highway | service        | For access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. Can be used in conjunction with service=* to indicate the type of usage and with access=* to indicate who can use it and in what circumstances. |
| highway | motorway_link  | The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a motorway from/to a motorway or lower class highway. Normally with the same motorway restrictions. |
| highway | trunk_link     | The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a trunk road from/to a trunk road or lower class highway. |
| highway | primary_link   | The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a primary road from/to a primary road or lower class highway. |
| highway | secondary_link | The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a secondary road from/to a secondary road or lower class highway. |
| highway | tertiary_link  | The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a tertiary road from/to a tertiary road or lower class highway. |
| highway | living_street  | For living streets, which are residential streets where pedestrians have legal priority over cars, speeds are kept very low and where children are allowed to play on the street. |
| highway | pedestrian     | For roads used mainly/exclusively for pedestrians in shopping and some residential areas which may allow access by motorised vehicles only for very limited periods of the day. To create a 'square' or 'plaza' create a closed way and tag as pedestrian and also with area=yes. |
| highway | track          | Roads for mostly agricultural or forestry uses. To describe the quality of a track, see tracktype=*. Note: Although tracks are often rough with unpaved surfaces, this tag is not describing the quality of a road but its use. Consequently, if you want to tag a general use road, use one of the general highway values instead of track. |
| highway | bus_guideway   | A busway where the vehicle guided by the way (though not a railway) and is not suitable for other traffic. Please note: this is not a normal bus lane, use access=no, psv=yes instead! |
| highway | escape         | For runaway truck ramps, runaway truck lanes, emergency escape ramps, or truck arrester beds. It enables vehicles with braking failure to safely stop. |
| highway | raceway        | A course or track for (motor) racing |
| highway | road           | A road/way/street/motorway/etc. of unknown type. It can stand for anything ranging from a footpath to a motorway. This tag should only be used temporarily until the road/way/etc. has been properly surveyed. If you do know the road type, do not use this value, instead use one of the more specific highway=* values. |
| highway | footway        | For designated footpaths; i.e., mainly/exclusively for pedestrians. This includes walking tracks and gravel paths. If bicycles are allowed as well, you can indicate this by adding a bicycle=yes tag. Should not be used for paths where the primary or intended usage is unknown. Use highway=pedestrian for pedestrianised roads in shopping or residential areas and highway=track if it is usable by agricultural or similar vehicles. |
| highway | bridleway      | For horses. Equivalent to highway=path + horse=designated. |
| highway | steps          | For flights of steps (stairs) on footways. Use with step_count=* to indicate the number of steps |
| highway | path           | A non-specific path. Use highway=footway for paths mainly for walkers, highway=cycleway for one also usable by cyclists, highway=bridleway for ones available to horses as well as walkers and highway=track for ones which is passable by agriculture or similar vehicles. |
| highway | cycleway       | For designated cycleways. Add foot=* only if default-access-restrictions do not apply. |

We can put these values into a table in our database and use the following query to create a new table with only the desired roads.

#+BEGIN_SRC: sql
create table "ways" as
  select "osm_id", "highway", "way"
  from "planet_osm_line"
  where "highway" in
    (select "value" from "highway_values");
#+END_SRC

*** How to get an up-to-date OSM in PostGIS
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
How to build an OSM database that is up to date.
Rather than doing a quarterly manual job of downloading a 14Gb+ file, decompressing it (250Gb+) and inserting it into a database it will be a lot easier to download daily (50Mb) OSM change files (.osc) and apply the changes to the existing database.

The instructions below is a modified version of Martin van Exel's tutorial here - https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1paaYsOakgJEYP380R70s4SGYq8ME3ASl-mweVi1DlQ4

# now pop into PostgreSQL and build a suitable database & user (could be tidier)
adduser osm
passwd osm
# and some badly chosen password: osm, osm
su - postgres psql
createdb osm
createlang plpgsql osm
CREATE USER osm WITH PASSWORD 'osm';
#CREATE DATABASE osm;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE osm to osm;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE osm to postgres;
\q
psql -d osm -U osm -f /usr/pgsql-9.1/share/contrib/postgis-2.0/postgis.sql
psql -d osm -U osm f /usr/pgsql-9.1/share/contrib/postgis-2.0/spatial_ref_sys.sql
psql -U osm -d osm
CREATE EXTENSION hstore;
\q
psql -U osm -d osm -f /home/<user name>/osm/osmosis-0.41/script/pgsimple_schema_0.6.sql

# make some directories and get some data
su mkdir /tmp/osm
cd tmp/osm
mkdir planet
mkdir planet/replication

# now get some OSM data - either get the whole planet.. or get a sample from http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/
cd /tmp/osm/planet/
wget http://planet.openstreetmap.org/planet-latest.osm.bz2

# and thump into the database (using the VERY IMPORTANT --slim option, -C is how much memory we're setting aside for this: 4Gb in this case) /opt/osm2pgsql/osm2pgsql -S default.style --slim -d osm -C 4000 /tmp/osm/planet/planet-latest.osm.bz2

# create the configuration.txt and download.lock
osmosis --rrii workingDirectory=/tmp/osm/planet/replication

# create your state.txt file, visit http://toolserver.org/~mazder/replicate-sequences/ and enter details. To check the datetime required examine the contents of the bz2 file.

bunzip2 -c planet-latest.osm.bz2 | head


Now at this point I've been running osmosis to grab the change file and osm2pgsql to throw it at the database but you can apparently run osmosis on it's own;

# Osmosis on it's own version
/opt/osmosis-0.41/bin/osmosis --rri workingDirectory=/tmp/osm/planet/replication --sc --wpc user="osm" database="osm" password="osm"

# Or the two command route - grab a change file from the queue of necessary changes to perform
/opt/osmosis-0.41/bin/osmosis --rri workingDirectory=/tmp/osm/planet/replication --simplify-change --write-xml-change /tmp/osm/planet/replication/changes.osc.gz

# And append the changes to the database
/opt/osm2pgsql/osm2pgsql --append -S /opt/osm2pgsql/default.style -d osm -U postgres --slim /tmp/osm/planet/replication/changes.osc.gz

# You can put either set of commands into a script and cron it up, here's the script for the osm2pgsql route

#!/bin/sh
n=`ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep /opt/osmosis-0.41/ | wc -l`
m=`ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep /opt/osm2pgsql/ | wc -l`
let i=n+m
if [ $i -gt 0 ]; then
 echo osmosis or osm2pgsql running
else
 echo not running
 /opt/osmosis-0.41/bin/osmosis --rri workingDirectory=/tmp/osm/planet/replication --simplify-change --write-xml-change /tmp/osm/planet/replication/changes.osc.gz
 /opt/osm2pgsql/osm2pgsql --append -S /opt/osm2pgsql/default.style -d osm -U postgres --slim /tmp/osm/planet/replication/changes.osc.gz
fi

# Now you're probably running mod_tile and mapnik to render and serve up OSM tiles so we need a method to tell mod_tile to re-render all tiles that have updates. We can amend the osm2pgsql call with -e options to produce a list of tiles that need to be expired and thus re-rendered. [See OSM Tile Expire Methods].
# change the osm2pgsql command to read
 /opt/osm2pgsql/osm2pgsql --append -S /opt/osm2pgsql/default.style -d osm -U postgres --slim /tmp/osm/planet/replication/changes.osc.gz -e15 -o expire.list

# We now expire all tiles listed in the expire.list. I haven't included the install and setup of Mapnik or mod_tile so i'm going to use some dummy locations for them. I'm expiring tiles from zoom level 6 and downwards
cat expire.list | /opt/mapnik/mod_tile/render_expired --map=osm --min-zoom=6 --touch-from=7 >/dev/null

# The OSM Tile Expire Methods guide also recommends a daily re-render of the lower zoom levels.

* Using PGRouting from Python
There is a Python package to access the PGRouting database: [[https://github.com/herrkaefer/psycopgr][=psycopgr=]]. It has a tutorial.
** Installing
With any Python installation, just type:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install psycopgr
#+END_SRC

* Introduction to C#/.NET
The Itinero/OpenLR library is written in C#. To build software using it, you'll need a C# SDK, which can be downloaded from Microsoft: [[https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started][Get started with .NET]]

C# is a language developed by Microsoft, much like Java. It compiles to the virtual platform known as the CLR (Common Language Runtime). Together with a library of standard classes (FCL) this environment is .NET. The .NET environment runs on all major platforms (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android...) making applications written in a .NET language (C#, F#, Visual Basic) portable.

If you have successfully installed the .NET SDK you should have the =dotnet= command-line tool.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports both
dotnet --version
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.1.4

** Creating a new project
A new project is created using =dotnet new=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
dotnet new console --name my-openlr-tool --language C#
#+END_SRC

Then the new project is run using =dotnet run=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :exports both
cd my-openlr-tool
dotnet run
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello World!

Our console application was initialized with a  friendly "Hello World!". We will be extending the "Hello World!" example with the first OpenLR example.

#+BEGIN_SRC csharp :tangle my-openlr-tool/Program.cs :noweb no-export
  using System;

  <<first-example-imports>>

  namespace my_openlr_tool
  {
      class Program
      {
	  static void Main(string[] args)
	  {
	      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

	      <<first-example-load-data>>
	      <<first-example-encode-line>>
	  }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

** Adding OpenLR as dependency
The .NET environment has two ways of adding external libraries to a project: packages and references. Adding a package will obtain a pre-compiled library from [[https://www.nuget.org/][NuGet]].

Documentation for OpenLR is a bit scarce: [[docs.itinero.tech]].

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :prologue "cd my-openlr-tool" :results silent
dotnet add package Itinero
dotnet add package Itinero.IO.Osm
dotnet add package OpenLR
#+END_SRC

** Import libraries
#+NAME: first-example-imports
#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  // import File
  using System.IO;

  // import RouterDb
  using Itinero;
  // import method RouterDb.LoadOsmData
  using Itinero.IO.Osm;
  // import Vehicle
  using Itinero.Osm.Vehicles;

  // import Coder
  using OpenLR;
  // import OsmCoderProfile
  using OpenLR.Osm;
  // import ReferencedLine
  using OpenLR.Referenced.Locations;
#+END_SRC

** Running a first example
The following example encodes and decodes a line in Luxembourg. This loads OSM data from a PBF, which can be found on [[http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/luxembourg.html][GeoFabrik.de]].

*** Load the map
First we need to load the PBF file into the RouterDB. Loading the Luxembourg data takes a few seconds.

#+NAME: first-example-load-data
#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  Console.Write("Loading Luxembourg ... ");
  var routerDb = new RouterDb();
  using (var sourceStream =
	 File.OpenRead(
	     Path.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory,
			  "../../../luxembourg-latest.osm.pbf")))
  {
      routerDb.LoadOsmData(sourceStream, Vehicle.Car);
  }
  Console.WriteLine("done");
#+END_SRC

*** Encode a line
Next we encode a line between two coordinates and then decode it again.

#+NAME: first-example-encode-line
#+BEGIN_SRC csharp
  // create coder.
  var coder = new Coder(routerDb, new OsmCoderProfile());

  Console.WriteLine("Building a line location, and encoding it.");
  // build a line location from a shortest path.
  var line = coder.BuildLine(
      new Itinero.LocalGeo.Coordinate(
	  49.67218282319583f, 6.142280101776122f),
      new Itinero.LocalGeo.Coordinate(
	  49.67776489459803f, 6.1342549324035645f));

  Console.WriteLine("original line: {0} --> {1}",
		    line.StartLocation,
		    line.EndLocation);

  // encode this location.
  var encoded = coder.Encode(line);
  Console.WriteLine("encoded line: {0}", encoded);

  // decode this location.
  var decodedLine = coder.Decode(encoded) as ReferencedLine;
  Console.WriteLine("decoded line: {0} --> {1}",
		    decodedLine.StartLocation,
		    decodedLine.EndLocation);
#+END_SRC

Running this example should give the following output:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results verbatim :exports results
cd my-openlr-tool
dotnet run
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello World!
: Loading Luxembourg ... done
: Building a line location, and encoding it.
: original line: 17060@0% [49.67221,6.14243]  --> 10712@0% [49.67784,6.133887]
: encoded line: CwReMiNSjSOYEvyqAjIjaAIG
: decoded line: 17060@0% [49.67221,6.14243]  --> 10712@0% [49.67784,6.133887]
